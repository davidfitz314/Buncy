# Buncy
Using a 2d glut environment, gravity and friction is simulated on multiple balls of varying sizes.
The balls start from a random position and are initially given a random speed and direction, then gravity and friction interact with them.
As the balls slow down they also interact with other balls to create a bouncing effect.
